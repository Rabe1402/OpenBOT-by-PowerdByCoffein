# OpenBOT-by-PowerdByCoffein

Codes for the KeplerOpenBOT from the "PowerdByCoffein Team. 

At the moment (May 12) the code is not working. We have a problem in the arduino code that prevents from reading the CAmera Date that is send over SPI. 

In de BaseCode folder is the code from the [lbotics website](https://www.lbotics.at/kepleropenbot/sensoren/openmv-cam). This code working just fine.
